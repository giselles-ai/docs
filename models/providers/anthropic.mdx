## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal Claude model:

- **For the ultimate coding powerhouse and most complex reasoning**: `claude-4-opus-20250514`
- **For balanced high-performance, everyday coding, and cost-effective workflows**: `claude-4-sonnet-20250514`
- **For best overall intelligence and complex reasoning (previous generation)**: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- **When speed and immediate responsiveness matter**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`

## Practices for Giselle
We recommend `claude-4-opus-20250514` or `claude-4-sonnet-20250514` as your primary models in Giselle, especially for tasks involving advanced coding, complex problem-solving, and in-depth analysis. Both models feature hybrid reasoning modes, automatically switching between instant responses and extended thinking based on task complexity.

`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` remains a strong choice for its proven reasoning capabilities. These models excel not only at code generation, architectural design, and technical reviews but also produce remarkably natural text. Their "Reasoning" (Extended Thinking) capability, supported in Giselle, makes them particularly powerful for tasks requiring multi-step thought processes. These versatile models can be effectively utilized across a broad spectrum of tasks, from creating engaging blog articles to writing complex code implementations and performing detailed analytical work.
