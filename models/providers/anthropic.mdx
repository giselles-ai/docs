## Claude Models

The following Claude models are available in the Anthropic workspace. Each model offers specific capabilities and features tailored to match your use case requirements. The "Reasoning" (Extended Thinking) capability, supported in Giselle, is available only in the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. All three models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) now support Web Search functionality.

## Web Search Functionality

All Claude models now support Web Search capabilities, allowing them to access current information from across the web. This feature enables Claude to provide up-to-date insights and information in responses. Key aspects of the Web Search functionality:

- **Real-time information**: Access to current data, news, and specialized knowledge
- **Citations**: Web-sourced responses include citations to source materials
- **Control options**: Organizations can use domain allow lists or block lists to control which sources Claude can access
- **Multiple searches**: Claude can conduct progressive searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries
- **Pricing**: Web Search is available at $10 per 1,000 searches plus standard token costs

### Use Cases for Web Search

The Web Search functionality enables a wide range of applications:

- **Financial services**: Analyze real-time stock prices, market trends, and regulatory updates
- **Legal research**: Access recent court decisions, regulatory changes, and legal news
- **Developer tools**: Reference the latest API documentation, GitHub releases, and technology updates
- **Productivity**: Incorporate the latest company reports, competitive intelligence, or industry research

## Practices for Giselle
We recommend claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 as your primary model in Giselle. It excels not only at code generation, architectural design, and technical reviews, but also produces remarkably natural text. Its standout feature, the "Reasoning" (Extended Thinking) capability, now fully supported in Giselle, makes it particularly powerful for complex problem-solving, in-depth analysis, and tasks requiring multi-step thought processes. When combined with Web Search functionality, this model becomes even more effective for tasks requiring up-to-date information. This versatile model can be effectively utilized across a broad spectrum of tasks, from creating engaging blog articles to writing complex code implementations and performing detailed analytical work.
