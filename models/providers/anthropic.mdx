## Practices for Giselle

We recommend `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`, `claude-4-opus-20250514` or `claude-4-sonnet-20250514` as your primary models in Giselle, especially for tasks involving advanced coding, complex problem-solving, and in-depth analysis. These models feature hybrid reasoning modes, automatically switching between instant responses and extended thinking based on task complexity.

`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` remains a strong choice for its proven reasoning capabilities. These models excel not only at code generation, architectural design, and technical reviews but also produce remarkably natural text. Their "Reasoning" (Extended Thinking) capability, supported in Giselle, makes them particularly powerful for tasks requiring multi-step thought processes. These versatile models can be effectively utilized across a broad spectrum of tasks, from creating engaging blog articles to writing complex code implementations and performing detailed analytical work.

### Anthropic Web Search Tool

For supported Claude models, Giselle integrates the Anthropic Web Search tool, which can be configured directly from a Generator Node's **Tools** tab. This feature allows Claude to access real-time information from the web, enabling it to answer questions and generate content based on the most up-to-date data, complete with source citations.

#### Configuration

In the Generator Node, navigate to the **Tools** tab and click **Configure** next to "Anthropic Web Search." You can then:

*   **Enable Tool**: Toggle the web search functionality on or off.
*   **Set Maximum Uses**: Limit the number of web searches the model can perform in a single run (from 1 to 10).
*   **Filter Domains**: Control the search scope by either:
    *   **Allowing Specific Domains**: Restricting searches to a whitelist of trusted sources.
    *   **Blocking Specific Domains**: Excluding certain websites from the search results.
