#### claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
The most advanced model offering superior intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Ideal for handling complex tasks, extended reasoning, detailed analyses, and multimodal tasks involving PDFs and images. It includes an extensive context window of up to 200k tokens with optional extended thinking capabilities allowing outputs up to 64k tokens (128k tokens available in beta).

#### claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
High-level intelligence model providing excellent general-purpose performance without extended reasoning capabilities. It supports multimodal inputs (PDF, images) and delivers robust text generation suitable for a wide range of applications with a context window of 200k tokens.

#### claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
Optimized for speed, this model is ideal for real-time responsiveness. It supports PDF and image inputs with rapid text generation, suitable for fast interactions and scenarios requiring quick, concise responses within a 200k token context window.

### Web Search

Anthropic's web search tool allows Claude models to access current information from the web, providing up-to-date insights for your queries. This feature is particularly useful for:

*   **Financial services:** Analyze real-time stock prices, market trends, and regulatory updates.
*   **Legal research:** Access recent court decisions, regulatory changes, and legal news.
*   **Developer tools:** Reference the latest API documentation, GitHub releases, and technology updates.
*   **Productivity:** Incorporate the latest company reports, competitive intelligence, or industry research.

Web search is available for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. Developers can control the use of web search, including setting `max_uses` for progressive searches and managing domain allow/block lists for enhanced control and trust.
