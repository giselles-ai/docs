## Perplexity AI Models

The following Perplexity AI models are available. Each model offers distinct capabilities tailored for various applications and needs.

| Models    | Generate Text | Web Search | Reasoning | Research Depth | Context Window | Max Output Tokens | Availability |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| sonar-pro | ✅             | ✅          | ❌         | High           | 200k tokens    | 8k tokens         | Pro          |
| sonar     | ✅             | ✅          | ❌         | Medium         | 128k tokens    | -                 | Free         |

Please note that some features may not be available within Giselle even if they are offered in the official API.

### sonar-pro

An advanced search model offering detailed responses with enhanced citation accuracy. Optimized for multi-step queries and tasks that require deep content understanding and comprehensive sourcing. Ideal for academic research, market analysis, and complex informational tasks.

### sonar

A lightweight, cost-effective search model optimized for quick, accurate answers utilizing real-time web search with citations. Suitable for everyday queries, quick fact-checking, summarizations, and general-purpose use.


## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal Perplexity AI model:

- **For advanced multi-step research queries with citations**: sonar-pro
- **For everyday quick searches and cost-effective queries**: sonar

## Practices for Giselle

### Multi-Node Research

In Giselle, you can set up multiple `sonar-pro` nodes to approach different perspectives, creating detailed, multifaceted research outputs similar to original deep-research reports.

### Search Domain Filtering

Both `sonar` and `sonar-pro` nodes in Giselle now support the `search_domain_filter` option, allowing you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the models. This feature is particularly useful for:

*   Restricting search results to trusted sources.
*   Filtering out specific domains (e.g., forums, social media).
*   Focusing research on particular websites.

**How to Use:**

*   **Allowlist (Include):** Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `"wikipedia.org"`, `"nasa.gov"`). The search will *only* use results from these domains.
*   **Denylist (Exclude):** Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `"pinterest.com"`, `"reddit.com"`). The search will *exclude* results from these domains.
*   **Combine:** You can mix included and excluded domains in the same request.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Simple Domain Names:** Use domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or `www.`.
*   **Main Domains:** Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all its subdomains as well.
*   **Limit Filter Size:** You can add a maximum of 10 domains. Using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.
*   **Relevance:** Use domains most relevant to your query for the best results.

**Performance Considerations:**

*   Adding domain filters might slightly increase response time.
*   Overly restrictive filters could lead to fewer search results, potentially affecting response quality.

<Note>
  The following section describes a **new Anthropic Web Search tool** and is included here as per specific instructions. For Anthropic-specific documentation, please refer to the [Anthropic provider overview](/models/providers/anthropic).
</Note>

## Anthropic Web Search Tool

Giselle now supports the **Anthropic Web Search tool** within Generator Nodes, enabling Anthropic AI models to access real-time web content for up-to-date information beyond their knowledge cutoff. This tool facilitates answering questions with current data and dynamically grounding responses.

### Configuring Anthropic Web Search

To enable and configure the Anthropic Web Search tool for a Generator Node using an Anthropic model:

1.  **Navigate to the Tools Tab**: In your Generator Node, select the **Tools** tab.
2.  **Locate Anthropic Web Search**: Find "Anthropic Web Search" in the list of available integrations and click the **Configure** button.
3.  **Enable/Disable Tool**: Use the toggle to enable or disable the tool.
4.  **Set Maximum Uses**:
    *   Specify the `Maximum Uses` for web searches within the range of 1 to 10. This limits how many times the AI model can perform a web search during a single generation task.
    *   **Validation**: The input will validate that the value is between 1 and 10.
5.  **Configure Domain Filtering**: Choose one of three filtering modes to control the scope of web searches:
    *   **No Filtering**: The AI model will search all available domains without any restrictions.
    *   **Allow Specific Domains**: Only search within the specified domains. All other domains will be blocked.
        *   **How to Use**: Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `example.com`, `wikipedia.org`).
    *   **Block Specific Domains**: Search all domains except those you specify. Blocked domains will be excluded.
        *   **How to Use**: Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `pinterest.com`, `reddit.com`).
    *   **Domain Validation**: Ensure valid domain names are entered (e.g., `example.com`). Invalid domains will trigger an error message.
    *   **Best Practices**:
        *   Use simple domain names (e.g., `example.com`, no `http://` or `www.`).
        *   Main domains (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all subdomains.
        *   Limit filters to a maximum of 10 domains for optimal performance.
        *   Use domains most relevant to your query.
6.  **Save Configuration**: After setting your preferences, click **Save** to apply the configuration to your Generator Node.

### Integration with Text Generation

Once configured, the Anthropic Web Search tool is automatically integrated into Anthropic text generation processes. The AI model will leverage the specified web search parameters when it determines a search is necessary to fulfill the prompt's requirements. This includes tracing support, adding a `tool:web-search` tag and `anthropic.webSearch` provider metadata to track usage and performance.

### Benefits

*   **Real-time Information**: Access up-to-date content for accurate responses.
*   **Reduced Hallucinations**: Ground AI responses with factual, current data.
*   **Controlled Search Scope**: Fine-tune search results through domain filtering for focused research.
