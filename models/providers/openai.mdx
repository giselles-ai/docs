*   **For the most powerful reasoning and complex analysis (including images, 200k context)**: `o3` (Pro)
*   **For flagship performance on complex tasks with very large context (1M tokens)**: `gpt-4.1` (Pro)
*   **For balanced performance with very large context (1M tokens) at lower cost**: `gpt-4.1-mini` (Free)
*   **For the most cost-effective option with very large context (1M tokens)**: `gpt-4.1-nano` (Free)
*   **For comprehensive, high-intelligence tasks with multimodal needs and web search (128k context)**: `gpt-4o` (Pro)
*   **For high-quality image generation from text or image inputs**: `gpt-image-1` (Pro)

## Practices for Giselle

We recommend **gpt-4.1** as a versatile primary model in Giselle for Pro users. It offers an excellent balance of capability, intelligence, and features (including web search via tool) across various tasks like business document creation, analysis, and research.

For tasks demanding the absolute highest level of reasoning or handling very large contexts (up to 200k tokens), consider **o3** or **o4-mini**. **o3** is the top choice for depth and stability, while **o4-mini** provides strong reasoning with better cost-efficiency.

The **GPT-4.1 series** (gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano) introduces a massive **~1 million token context window** across all tiers, along with improved coding and instruction following.
*   Use **gpt-4.1** for the most demanding tasks requiring the largest context.
*   **gpt-4.1-mini** offers a balance for large-context tasks at a lower cost.
*   **gpt-4.1-nano** is the most economical choice for leveraging the million-token context window.

For users on the Free plan or those prioritizing cost and speed for moderately complex tasks, **gpt-4.1-mini** (1M context) and **gpt-4.1-nano** (1M context) are the recommended choices.

For image generation needs, **gpt-image-1** provides high-quality results and supports both text and image inputs. The model offers different quality tiers to balance cost and detail based on specific requirements.

By combining these models in workflows, you can leverage their specific strengths. For example, use `gpt-4o` for initial research with web search, then pass the results to `o3` for deep analysis, or use `gpt-4.1` to analyze extremely large documents.
