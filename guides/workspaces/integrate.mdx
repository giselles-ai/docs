## GitHub

### GitHub App Integration

You can enhance your Giselle workspace by installing the official Giselle GitHub App. This integration allows you to connect your GitHub repositories with Giselle, enabling seamless workflows between your code and Giselle's AI apps.

### GitHub Pull Request Comment Trigger with Diff Support

Giselle's GitHub integration now supports an enhanced "Pull Request Comment" trigger. When configuring this trigger for events based on comments in GitHub Pull Requests, you now have the option to include the `diff` of the pull request.

If this option is enabled (by providing a value or selecting it in the UI), the trigger's output payload will contain the full diff content of the pull request associated with the comment.

This allows your Giselle workflows to directly access and process the code changes discussed in the pull request, enabling more sophisticated automation, analysis, or context-aware responses.

### GitHub Comment Attribution

When the Giselle GitHub App comments on GitHub issues, pull requests, or other GitHub elements, it automatically includes an attribution line at the end of each comment. This attribution appears as:

> âœ¨ Giselle App: [this-is-sample-app](https://example.com/giselle-sample-app-url)

This reference helps team members identify which Giselle app generated the comment and provides a direct link to access that specific app in your Giselle workspace. This feature enhances traceability and makes it easier to navigate between GitHub and your Giselle environment.
