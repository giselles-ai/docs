## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal fal.ai model:

- **For highest artistic fidelity and professional results**: flux-pro/v1.1
- **For fastest image generation**: flux/schnell
- **For balanced image quality, typography, and efficiency**: stable-diffusion-v3-medium

## Practices for Giselle

We recommend flux-pro/v1.1 as your primary choice when exceptional detail, artistic accuracy, and overall superior image quality are essential. For real-time applications or projects requiring quick visual feedback, flux/schnell provides the necessary speed. When needing a versatile balance of quality, efficiency, and typographic precision, stable-diffusion-v3-medium is highly recommended.
