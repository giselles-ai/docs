## Perplexity AI Models

The following Perplexity AI models are available. Each model offers distinct capabilities tailored for various applications and needs.

| Models    | Generate Text | Web Search | Reasoning | Research Depth | Context Window | Max Output Tokens | Availability |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| sonar-pro | ✅             | ✅          | ❌         | High           | 200k tokens    | 8k tokens         | Pro          |
| sonar     | ✅             | ✅          | ❌         | Medium         | 128k tokens    | -                 | Free         |

Please note that some features may not be available within Giselle even if they are offered in the official API.

### sonar-pro

An advanced search model offering detailed responses with enhanced citation accuracy. Optimized for multi-step queries and tasks that require deep content understanding and comprehensive sourcing. Ideal for academic research, market analysis, and complex informational tasks.

### sonar

A lightweight, cost-effective search model optimized for quick, accurate answers utilizing real-time web search with citations. Suitable for everyday queries, quick fact-checking, summarizations, and general-purpose use.


## Model Selection Guide

Guidelines for selecting the optimal Perplexity AI model:

- **For advanced multi-step research queries with citations**: sonar-pro
- **For everyday quick searches and cost-effective queries**: sonar

## Practices for Giselle

### Multi-Node Research

In Giselle, you can set up multiple `sonar-pro` nodes to approach different perspectives, creating detailed, multifaceted research outputs similar to original deep-research reports.

### Search Domain Filtering

Both `sonar` and `sonar-pro` nodes in Giselle now support the `search_domain_filter` option, allowing you to control which websites are included in or excluded from the search results used by the models. This feature is particularly useful for:

*   Restricting search results to trusted sources.
*   Filtering out specific domains (e.g., forums, social media).
*   Focusing research on particular websites.

**How to Use:**

*   **Allowlist (Include):** Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `"wikipedia.org"`, `"nasa.gov"`). The search will *only* use results from these domains.
*   **Denylist (Exclude):** Provide a list of simple domain names (e.g., `"pinterest.com"`, `"reddit.com"`). The search will *exclude* results from these domains.
*   **Combine:** You can mix included and excluded domains in the same request.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Simple Domain Names:** Use domains in their simplest form (e.g., `example.com`) without protocol prefixes (`http://`, `https://`) or `www.`.
*   **Main Domains:** Using the main domain (e.g., `nytimes.com`) will filter all its subdomains as well.
*   **Limit Filter Size:** You can add a maximum of 10 domains. Using fewer, more targeted domains often yields better results.
*   **Relevance:** Use domains most relevant to your query for the best results.

**Performance Considerations:**

*   Adding domain filters might slightly increase response time.
*   Overly restrictive filters could lead to fewer search results, potentially affecting response quality.
