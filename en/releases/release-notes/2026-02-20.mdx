This release introduces Data Stores and Data Query nodes for connecting external databases to your workflows, adds Claude Opus 4.6 model support, and includes security improvements.

## Data Stores & Data Query Nodes

You can now connect external PostgreSQL databases to your Giselle workflows using the new **Data Store** and **Data Query** nodes:

- **[Data Store Node](/en/glossary/data-store-node)** — Register and manage connections to your PostgreSQL databases from Team Settings
- **[Data Query Node](/en/glossary/data-query-node)** — Query your connected data stores directly within workflows, with dynamic schema resolution and cancellation support

Data Stores are available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Configure your data stores in [Team Settings > Data Stores](/en/guides/settings/team/data-stores).
