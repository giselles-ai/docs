This major update brings a clearer naming convention, the latest Claude AI models, Document Vector Store for everyone, and a refreshed navigation experience.

## Apps Renamed to Workspaces

We've renamed **Apps** to **Workspaces** throughout the application. This change better reflects how you organize and manage your AI projects. Your existing projects remain exactly where they are—this is just a clearer name for the same great functionality.

## New Claude AI Models

We've upgraded our Anthropic model offerings with the latest Claude 4.5 and 4.1 series:

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — Anthropic's newest balanced model offering excellent performance for most tasks
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** — A faster, more efficient model ideal for quick tasks and cost-effective workflows

The older Claude 3.x models have been retired. Existing workflows will automatically use the new Claude 4.x equivalents.

## Document Vector Store Now Available for Everyone

The **Document Vector Store** feature is now available to all users. This powerful capability allows you to:

- Upload your own documents to create a searchable knowledge base
- Let your AI agents reference your documents when generating responses
- Build more informed and context-aware workflows

Previously available as a preview feature, Document Vector Store is now a core part of Giselle.

## Redesigned Navigation

The global navigation has been completely redesigned with a new **Navigation Rail** that makes it easier to:

- Switch between teams with clear team context
- Access your workspaces quickly
- Navigate to settings and other features

## Team Plans & Quotas

We've introduced team-based plans with quota management:

- Plan-based seat limits for team members
- Quota controls for Document Vector Stores
- Quota controls for GitHub Vector Stores

## Improved Email Experience

- New team invitation emails with a refreshed design
- Updated authentication emails (sign-in, password reset, etc.)

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Improved account settings page navigation
- Fixed GitHub vector store display issues
- Various UI refinements and stability improvements
