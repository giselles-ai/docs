description: GitHub Discussion triggers, improved node designs, and UI refinements
---

This update brings GitHub Discussion support, redesigned nodes, and various UI improvements across the platform.

## GitHub Discussion Triggers and Actions

You can now trigger workflows from **GitHub Discussions** and take actions on them. This enables you to:

- Automatically respond to new discussions in your repositories
- Build AI-powered community support workflows
- Create discussion summaries and insights

## GitHub Trigger Customization

GitHub Triggers now support customizable **callsigns and labels** after configuration. Change how your triggers appear and are identified without reconfiguring them from scratch.

## Node Design Improvements

We've improved the design of several node types:

- **Image Generation Node** — Redesigned with unified headers and improved image display
- **File Upload Node** — Improved layout for better file management
- **Query Node** — Replaced tabs with a scrollable layout for easier navigation

## GitHub Tools Configuration

The GitHub Tools configuration panel has been polished with:

- Cleaner interface for setting up GitHub integrations
- Better organization of configuration options
- Improved visual consistency

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed modal dialog layout issues in settings
- Fixed duplicate connections handling in workflow builds
- Fixed Workspaces header highlight
