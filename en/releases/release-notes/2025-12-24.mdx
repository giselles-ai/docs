description: Playground and Tasks now available to all users with dedicated app execution and results pages
---

This release makes Playground and Tasks generally available, providing dedicated pages for running apps and viewing execution results outside of the workspace editor.

## Playground and Tasks Now Generally Available

The stage feature flag is now enabled by default, making **Playground** and **Tasks** available to all users:

- **Playground** — A dedicated page for running your apps without entering the workspace editor. Simply select an app and execute it with a streamlined interface focused on input and output.
- **Tasks** — A comprehensive execution history page where you can view all your workflow runs with clear status indicators and detailed results.

The default landing page has changed from `/workspaces` to `/playground`, reflecting this new workflow-first experience.

## Enhanced Node Connectivity

Action nodes now support input connections from Start nodes, enabling more flexible workflow designs where actions can be triggered directly from the workflow entry point.

## UI Improvements

- Updated stage node colors with "blue-muted" styling for Start and End nodes
- Removed task ID from task page titles for cleaner presentation
- Added `LocalDateTime` component for task start time display
- Aligned document link styling across task and workspace pages

## Documentation Updates

- Added documentation URLs to node and task pages for easier access to help resources
- Updated workspace page documentation link URLs
