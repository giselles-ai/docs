This update introduces PostgreSQL tool support for text generation, enables GitHub Vector Store by default, adds clipboard paste for images, and brings the workflow run button for easier execution.

## PostgreSQL Tool Support

Added **PostgreSQL tool support** to text generation nodes. Connect your PostgreSQL databases and let AI agents query and analyze your data directly within workflows.

## GitHub Vector Store

**GitHub Vector Store** is now enabled by default for all users. Index your GitHub repositories and use them as knowledge bases for AI-powered code assistance and documentation.

## Clipboard Paste for Images

You can now **paste images directly from clipboard** into Image File Nodes. Simply copy an image and paste it into your workflow for faster image handling.

## Workflow Run Button

New **Run Button** for workflow execution. Start your workflows with a single click directly from the workflow designer.

## Team Member Management

Team members can now **leave teams** themselves, giving users more control over their team memberships.

## Differential Ingestion

Implemented **differential ingestion with version tracking** for GitHub repositories. Only changed files are re-indexed, making repository updates faster and more efficient.
