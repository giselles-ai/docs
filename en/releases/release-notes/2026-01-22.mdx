description: GPT-5.2 Codex model, Playground app selection, expandable task inputs, and GitHub Trigger comment control
---

This release adds the GPT-5.2 Codex model, improves the Playground and Tasks experience, and introduces control over GitHub Trigger in-progress comments.

## GPT-5.2 Codex Model

We've added support for **GPT-5.2 Codex**, OpenAI's code-focused model optimized for software engineering tasks. You can now select GPT-5.2 Codex in your Generator nodes for code generation and technical workflows.

## Playground App Selection

You can now select an app directly from the workflow designer and jump to Playground to run it. This streamlines the workflow from building to testing your apps.

## Tasks Page Improvements

- **Expandable input display** — String inputs are now shown in an expandable format in the task header, making it easier to review long inputs without leaving the task page

## GitHub Trigger In-Progress Comment Control

You can now control whether "in-progress" comments are posted to GitHub during workflow execution triggered by GitHub events. This gives you more flexibility over the notification behavior of your GitHub-integrated workflows.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Added magic byte validation for avatar uploads to prevent invalid file types
- Added server-side repository access validation for GitHub vector store
- Fixed task input placeholder not updating when switching apps
- Upgraded Node.js from 22 to 24
