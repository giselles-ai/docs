description: Gemini image generation, image editing, enhanced Image Generator Node, and cancelable text generation
---

This update brings Gemini-powered image generation, image editing capabilities, enhanced input support for Image Generator Nodes, and the ability to cancel long-running text generations.

## Gemini Image Generation (Nano Banana)

Added **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (codenamed Nano Banana) for text-to-image generation. You can now create images using Google's Gemini models directly in your workflows.

## Image Editing

The image generation capabilities now include **image editing** support. Edit and modify existing images as part of your AI workflows.

## Enhanced Image Generator Node

The **Image Generator Node** now supports the same input types as the Text Generator Node:

- Connect multiple input sources
- Reference outputs from other nodes
- Build more complex image generation workflows

## Cancelable Text Generation

You can now **cancel text generation** while it's in progress. This is especially useful for:

- Stopping long-running generations
- Testing and iterating faster
- Managing resource usage

## Long-Running Task Support

Redesigned the text generation pipeline to support **durable execution** beyond the previous 800-second limit. Complex, long-running AI tasks now complete reliably.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate and delete dialog issues on apps list
- Fixed prompt references missing after connecting inputs
- Added validation for empty prompts before generation
- Improved error handling for GitHub Trigger configuration
- Fixed open redirect vulnerability in OAuth callback
