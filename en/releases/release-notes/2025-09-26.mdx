This update introduces Document Vector Store for uploading your own documents, the GPT-5-codex model, @ mention functionality in prompts, and PDF text extraction.

## Document Vector Store

We've added **Document Vector Store**, allowing you to upload and manage your own documents as a searchable knowledge base:

- Upload documents directly to your workspace
- Your AI agents can reference uploaded documents when generating responses
- Integrated with Query nodes for seamless document retrieval
- Metadata tracking and version management for uploads

## GPT-5-codex Model

Added **GPT-5-codex** to the available OpenAI models. This model is optimized for code generation and understanding, making it ideal for:

- Code explanation and documentation
- Code review assistance
- Programming-related workflows

## @ Mentions in Prompts

You can now use **@ mentions** to reference other nodes directly in your prompts:

- Type `@` in the prompt editor to see available nodes
- Select a node to insert a reference
- The referenced node's output will be included as context

This makes it easier to build connected workflows where outputs from one node inform another.

## PDF Support

Document Vector Store now supports **PDF text extraction**:

- Upload PDF files directly
- Text content is automatically extracted and indexed
- Search and reference PDF content in your workflows

## UI Improvements

- Redesigned login page with improved styling
- Updated settings pages with better visual consistency
- Improved usage and team pages interface

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed node copy behavior—pasted nodes are now automatically selected
- Fixed connection handling in graph slicing
