description: Playground and Tasks post-GA improvements with app selection and expandable task inputs
---

This release brings several improvements to Playground and Tasks following their general availability, focusing on a smoother app execution experience.

## Playground App Selection

You can now select an app directly from the workflow designer and jump to Playground to run it. This streamlines the workflow from building to testing your apps.

## Tasks Page Improvements

- **Expandable input display** — String inputs are now shown in an expandable format in the task header, making it easier to review long inputs without leaving the task page

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Added magic byte validation for avatar uploads to prevent invalid file types
- Added server-side repository access validation for GitHub vector store
- Fixed task input placeholder not updating when switching apps
