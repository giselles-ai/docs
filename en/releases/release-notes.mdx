**Official Vector Stores Now Available to All Users**

We're making powerful knowledge bases accessible to everyone. This release introduces official vector stores—both document and GitHub-based—that you can use in your workflows without any setup. We've also improved team navigation with avatar icons and direct workspace links, plus enhanced GitHub integration with better error handling and a new reconnection UI for expired credentials.
