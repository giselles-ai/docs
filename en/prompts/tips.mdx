---

This document provides concrete, actionable tips tailored specifically for creating effective prompts within Giselle’s Generator Nodes. Unlike conversational UIs, Giselle uses a single-shot prompting model, meaning each prompt must be precise and complete on its own. While direct iterative refinement through conversation within a single node isn't possible, strategically chaining multiple nodes can significantly elevate the output quality through careful node integration and diverse data sourcing.

## Essential Principles

### 1. Ensure Clarity and Precision

- Clearly define the AI model’s role.
- Provide explicit, focused instructions without ambiguity.

```plaintext
❌ Poor example:
"Describe a useful invention."

✅ Good example:
"Role: Technology historian

Task: Provide a concise summary (100 words max) of the invention of the telephone, highlighting its historical significance and modern impact.

Output Format:
- Summary paragraph
- Clearly stated historical context and modern relevance"
```

### 2. Include Comprehensive Context

- Provide necessary background and purpose clearly in your prompt.
- Explicitly state constraints or expectations relevant to the task.

### 3. Specify Structured Outputs

- Clearly outline the desired response structure, length, and style.
- Define formats explicitly (e.g., bullet points, structured paragraphs, JSON, image dimensions).

## Advanced Node Integration Techniques

### 1. Effective Role Definition

Defining roles guides the AI to produce contextually accurate outputs:

```plaintext
✅ Example:
"Role: UX Designer

Task: Evaluate the provided web interface design for usability issues.

Output Format:
- List identified issues clearly
- Provide specific recommendations for improvements"
```

### 2. Sequential Node Chaining

Although Giselle nodes are single-shot, you can achieve iterative refinement by chaining multiple nodes:

1. **Ideation Node**: Generate initial ideas or concepts.
2. **Drafting Node**: Develop detailed drafts from initial concepts.
3. **Review Node**: Critically evaluate drafts and suggest improvements.

### 3. Leveraging Multi-Node Workflows

Combine diverse AI models across nodes to maximize output quality:

- **Perplexity Sonar** for research and fact verification.
- **Claude** for nuanced analysis and ethical considerations.
- **GPT-4o** for structured and creative content creation.
- **Fal AI** for high-quality image and visual content generation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overly Restrictive Instructions

Avoid excessively rigid constraints:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Create a detailed report exactly 200 words, including exactly four examples."
```

### 2. Contradictory or Confusing Instructions

Ensure instructions remain logically consistent:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Provide a highly detailed yet simple explanation using advanced terminology."
```

### 3. Ambiguous or Incomplete Prompts

Avoid vague instructions that lead to unclear outputs:

```plaintext
❌ Avoid:
"Explain something useful."
```

## Optimizing Giselle Workflows

### 1. Iterative Node Refinement

- Regularly review outputs from each node to optimize subsequent prompts.
- Use multiple nodes strategically to iteratively refine concepts, drafts, and final outputs.

### 2. Strategic Use of Templates

Leverage prompt templates for consistent, effective outputs:

```plaintext
✅ Giselle Template:

Role: [Defined AI role]

Task: [Explicit, precise task description]

Constraints:
- [Specific constraint or limitation]
- [Additional constraints as necessary]

Input Data:
- [Clearly referenced or provided data]

Output Format:
- [Detailed expected structure of response]
```

## Giselle-Specific Recommendations

### 1. Select Appropriate AI Models

Choose AI models carefully according to task requirements and capabilities:

- **Claude**: nuanced, ethical analyses.
- **Gemini**: complex multimodal inputs.
- **GPT-4o**: structured outputs and creative content.
- **Fal AI**: image generation tasks.

### 2. Visualize and Collaborate

- Clearly map your workflows visually within Giselle’s UI.
- Share your workflows with teams to enhance collaboration and clarity.
- Experiment with node combinations to achieve advanced, high-quality results beyond standard conversational interfaces.

## Key Points for Effective Giselle Prompts

- **Role Definition**: Clearly articulate the AI model’s role.
- **Precision**: Provide exact, detailed instructions.
- **Contextual Completeness**: Include essential context and constraints.
- **Output Structure**: Clearly define response formats.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Strategically chain multiple nodes to enhance output quality.
