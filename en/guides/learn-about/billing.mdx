## Payment Guide 

This guide explains how Giselle's pricing system works, including subscription management, billing cycles, and secure payments. Giselle uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for simplified billing to ensure safe and reliable transactions.

## How to Access Billing Settings

After logging in, you can accessã€€[Settings > Team > Billing](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/billing) by selecting "Billing" from the sidebar menu. 

From this page, you can access the dedicated billing portal provided by Stripe.
In the Stripe billing portal, you can:

View your current subscription details

Subscription cancellation is possible through the Stripe management screen. You cannot cancel directly from the Giselle management interface.
