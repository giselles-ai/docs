## Trigger Node in Giselle

The **Trigger Node** is the starting point for running the workflow built in the Giselle App. It initiates the execution of the connected nodes in a sequence.

Currently, two types of Trigger Nodes are supported.

### Manual Trigger Node

The **Manual Trigger Node** allows you to start your workflow with the click of a button. You can also configure it to request specific parameters each time it's run. This is useful for providing dynamic inputs to your workflow at the moment of execution.

**Configuring Manual Trigger Parameters:**

When you add a Manual Trigger Node to your workflow, you can define parameters that will be requested when the flow is manually triggered. If no parameters are configured, the flow will simply start when triggered.

To add and configure parameters:

1.  In the "Add New Parameter" section:
    *   **Parameter Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the parameter (e.g., "Title", "Message", "Priority"). This name will be used to identify the input field when the trigger is run.
    *   **Type**: Select the type of data this parameter will accept. The available options are:
        *   **Text**: For single-line text input.
        *   **Text(multi-line)**: For longer text input that may span multiple lines.
        *   **Number**: For numerical input.
    *   **Required**: Check this box if the parameter must be filled in before the workflow can be triggered. An error will occur if a required parameter is left empty.
2.  Click the **plus icon (+)** to add the configured parameter to the list.
3.  You can add multiple parameters by repeating the steps above.
4.  Once all desired parameters are added and configured, click **Save Configuration**.

When you manually run this workflow, a form will appear prompting you to enter values for the parameters you've defined. These values can then be used by subsequent nodes in your workflow.

### GitHub Trigger Node

The **GitHub Trigger Node** enables you to automatically start your Giselle workflows based on specific events occurring in your GitHub repositories. This allows for seamless integration between your code management and AI-powered tasks.

**Setting up a GitHub Trigger:**

1.  **Select GitHub Account/Organization**:
    *   When you add a GitHub Trigger node, you'll first need to choose the GitHub account or organization where your target repository resides (e.g., `giselles-ai`, `liam-hq`).
    *   If you're missing a GitHub account connection or need to adjust permissions, click on "Adjust GitHub App Permissions".

2.  **Choose a Repository**:
    *   A list of repositories available under the selected account/organization will be displayed (e.g., `docs`, `giselle`).
    *   Click the **Set up** button next to the desired repository (e.g., `giselle`).
    *   If your repository isn't listed, you might need to "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" to grant Giselle access to it.

3.  **Configure the Trigger Event**:
    *   Once a repository is selected (e.g., `giselles-ai/giselle`), you need to specify which GitHub event will trigger the workflow.
    *   Click on the dropdown menu labeled "Choose when you want to trigger the flow."
    *   Select an event from the list, such as:
        *   **Issue Created**: Triggers the flow when a new issue is created in the repository.
        *   **Issue Closed**: Triggers when an issue is closed.
        *   **Issue Comment Created**: Triggers when a new comment is made on an issue.
        *   **Pull Request Comment Created**: Triggers on a new pull request comment.
        *   **Pull Request Opened**: Triggers when a new pull request is opened.
        *   **Pull Request Ready for Review**: Triggers when a pull request is marked as ready for review.
        *   **Pull Request Closed**: Triggers when a pull request is closed.

4.  **Configure Callsign (for specific events)**:
    *   For some events, like "Issue Comment Created" or "Pull Request Comment Created," you can specify a **Callsign**.
    *   A Callsign is a specific string or command (e.g., `/code-review`, `/deep-research`) that must be present in the comment for the trigger to activate. This prevents the flow from running on every single comment.
    *   Enter your desired Callsign in the provided field. The example shows `/code-review`.
    *   Click **Set up** after configuring the Callsign.

5.  **Enable the Trigger**:
    *   After configuring the event and any associated options (like Callsign), the trigger will initially be in a "Disabled" state. The node on the canvas will show "Requires Setup" or display the repository and event type with a "Disabled" status.
    *   On the configuration panel for the trigger (e.g., "On Issue Created" or "On Issue Comment Created"), you will see the current **State** as "Disable".
    *   Click on **Enable** to activate the trigger.
    *   Once enabled, the **State** will change to "Enable", and you will see an option to **Disable Trigger**. The node on the canvas will also reflect its "Enabled" status.

6.  **Run in the workspace**:
    * For GitHub Trigger Nodes, clicking the "Run" button allows you to test your workflow without waiting for an actual GitHub webhook. You can enter values in a form that simulates the GitHub event, enabling you to verify that your workflow functions correctly before enabling it for real GitHub events.

**Example Workflow after Setup:**

On Issue Created:
*   **Trigger**: "On Issue Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle`.
*   **State**: Enabled.
*   **Action**: When a new issue is created in the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository, this Giselle workflow will automatically start.

On Pull Request Comment Created:
*   **Trigger**: "On Pull Request Comment Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with Callsign `/code-review`.
*   **State**: Enabled.
*   **Action**: When a comment containing `/code-review [enter your request...]` is posted on a pull request in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this workflow will start. The subsequent nodes can then access information like the comment body, pull request number, the pull request's diff content, etc.
